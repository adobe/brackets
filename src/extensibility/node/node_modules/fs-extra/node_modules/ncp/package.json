If there are errors, the error messages will be logged to `stdout` and to `./ncp-debug.log`, and the copy operation will attempt to continue.\n\n## Programmatic usage\n\nProgrammatic usage of `ncp` is just as simple.  The only argument to the completion callback is a possible error.  \n\n```javascript\nvar ncp = require('ncp').ncp;\n\nncp.limit = 16;\n\nncp(source, destination, function (err) {\n if (err) {\n   return console.error(err);\n }\n console.log('done!');\n});\n```\n\nYou can also call ncp like `ncp(source, destination, options, callback)`. \n`options` should be a dictionary. Currently, such options are available:\n\n  * `options.filter` - a `RegExp` instance, against which each file name is\n  tested to determine whether to copy it or not, or a function taking single\n  parameter: copied file name, returning `true` or `false`, determining\n  whether to copy file or not.\n\n  * `options.transform` - a function: `function (read, write) { read.pipe(write) }`\n  used to apply streaming transforms while copying.\n\n  * `options.clobber` - boolean=true. if set to false, `ncp` will not overwrite \n  destination files that already exist.\n\nPlease open an issue if any bugs arise.  As always, I accept (working) pull requests, and refunds are available at `/dev/null`.\n",
