Why pthreads-win32 did not use the GNU General Public License
-------------------------------------------------------------

    The goal of the pthreads-win32 project has been to
    provide a quality and complete implementation of the POSIX
    threads API for Microsoft Windows within the limits imposed
    by virtue of it being a stand-alone library and not
    linked directly to other POSIX compliant libraries. For
    example, some functions and features, such as those based
    on POSIX signals, are missing.

    Pthreads-win32 is a library, available in several different
    versions depending on supported compilers, and may be used
    as a dynamically linked module or a statically linked set of
    binary modules. It is not an application on it's own.

    It was fully intended that pthreads-win32 be usable with
    commercial software not covered by either the GPL or the LGPL
    licenses. Pthreads-win32 has many contributors to it's
    code base, many of whom have done so because they have
    used the library in commercial or proprietry software
    projects.

    Releasing pthreads-win32 under the LGPL ensures that the
    library can be used widely, while at the same time ensures
    that bug fixes and improvements to the pthreads-win32 code
    itself is returned to benefit all current and future users
    of the library.

    Although pthreads-win32 makes it possible for applications
    that use POSIX threads to be ported to Win32 platforms, the
    broader goal of the project is to encourage the use of open
    standards, and in particular, to make it just a little easier
    for developers writing Win32 applications to consider
    widening the potential market for their products.
