 * Test Synopsis:
 * - Test multiple pthread_cond_broadcasts with thread cancelation.
 *
 * Test Method (Validation or Falsification):
 * - Validation
 *
 * Requirements Tested:
 * - 
 *
 * Features Tested:
 * - 
 *
 * Cases Tested:
 * - 
 *
 * Description:
 * - Make NUMTHREADS threads wait on CV, cancel one, broadcast signal them,
 *   and then repeat.
 *
 * Environment:
 * - 
 *
 * Input:
 * - None.
 *
 * Output:
 * - File name, Line number, and failed expression on failure.
 * - No output on success.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 * - 
 *
 * Pass Criteria:
 * - Process returns zero exit status.
 *
 * Fail Criteria:
 * - Process returns non-zero exit status.
