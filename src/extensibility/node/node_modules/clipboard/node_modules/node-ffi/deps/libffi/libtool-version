# This file is used to maintain libtool version info for libffi.  See
# the libtool manual to understand the meaning of the fields.  This is
# a separate file so that version updates don't involve re-running
# automake.
#
# Here are a set of rules to help you update your library version
# information:
# 
# 1. Start with version information of `0:0:0' for each libtool library.
#
# 2. Update the version information only immediately before a public
#    release of your software. More frequent updates are unnecessary,
#    and only guarantee that the current interface number gets larger
#    faster.
#
# 3. If the library source code has changed at all since the last
#    update, then increment revision (`c:r:a' becomes `c:r+1:a').
#
# 4. If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the
#    last update, increment current, and set revision to 0.
#
# 5. If any interfaces have been added since the last public release,
#    then increment age.
#
# 6. If any interfaces have been removed since the last public
#    release, then set age to 0.
#
# CURRENT:REVISION:AGE
6:0:0
