 * Test Synopsis: Test canceling a Win32 thread having created an
 * implicit POSIX handle for it.
 *
 * Test Method (Validation or Falsification):
 * - Validate return value and that POSIX handle is created and destroyed.
 *
 * Requirements Tested:
 * -
 *
 * Features Tested:
 * - 
 *
 * Cases Tested:
 * - 
 *
 * Description:
 * - 
 *
 * Environment:
 * - 
 *
 * Input:
 * - None.
 *
 * Output:
 * - File name, Line number, and failed expression on failure.
 * - No output on success.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 * - have working pthread_create, pthread_self, pthread_mutex_lock/unlock
 *   pthread_testcancel, pthread_cancel
 *
 * Pass Criteria:
 * - Process returns zero exit status.
 *
 * Fail Criteria:
 * - Process returns non-zero exit status.
