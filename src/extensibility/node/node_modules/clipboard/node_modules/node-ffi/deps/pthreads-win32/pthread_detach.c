     /*

      * DOCPUBLIC
      *      This function detaches the given thread.
      *
      * PARAMETERS
      *      thread
      *              an instance of a pthread_t
      *
      *
      * DESCRIPTION
      *      This function detaches the given thread. You may use it to
      *      detach the main thread or to detach a joinable thread.
      *      NOTE:   detached threads cannot be joined;
      *              storage is freed immediately on termination.
      *
      * RESULTS
      *              0               successfully detached the thread,
      *              EINVAL          thread is not a joinable thread,
      *              ENOSPC          a required resource has been exhausted,
      *              ESRCH           no thread could be found for 'thread',
