pthread_setcancelstate (int state, int *oldstate)
     /*
      * ------------------------------------------------------
      * DOCPUBLIC
      *      This function atomically sets the calling thread's
      *      cancelability state to 'state' and returns the previous
      *      cancelability state at the location referenced by
      *      'oldstate'
      *
      * PARAMETERS
      *      state,
      *      oldstate
      *              PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE
      *                      cancellation is enabled,
      *
      *              PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE
      *                      cancellation is disabled
      *
      *
      * DESCRIPTION
      *      This function atomically sets the calling thread's
      *      cancelability state to 'state' and returns the previous
      *      cancelability state at the location referenced by
      *      'oldstate'.
      *
      *      NOTES:
      *      1)      Use to disable cancellation around 'atomic' code that
      *              includes cancellation points
      *
      * COMPATIBILITY ADDITIONS
      *      If 'oldstate' is NULL then the previous state is not returned
      *      but the function still succeeds. (Solaris)
      *
      * RESULTS
      *              0               successfully set cancelability type,
      *              EINVAL          'state' is invalid
      *
