 * Test Synopsis:
 * - Test CV linked list management and serialisation.
 *
 * Test Method (Validation or Falsification):
 * - Validation:
 *   Initiate and destroy several CVs in random order.
 *   Asynchronously traverse the CV list and broadcast.
 *
 * Requirements Tested:
 * - 
 *
 * Features Tested:
 * - 
 *
 * Cases Tested:
 * - 
 *
 * Description:
 * - Creates and then imediately destroys a CV. Does not
 *   test the CV.
 *
 * Environment:
 * - 
 *
 * Input:
 * - None.
 *
 * Output:
 * - File name, Line number, and failed expression on failure.
 * - No output on success.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 * -
 *
 * Pass Criteria:
 * - All initialised CVs destroyed without segfault.
 * - Successfully broadcasts all remaining CVs after
 *   each CV is removed.
 *
 * Fail Criteria:
