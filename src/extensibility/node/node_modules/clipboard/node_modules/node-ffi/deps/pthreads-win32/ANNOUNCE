	 Maintainer: Ross Johnson <rpj@callisto.canberra.edu.au>


We are pleased to announce the availability of a new release of
Pthreads-win32, an Open Source Software implementation of the
Threads component of the POSIX 1003.1 2001 Standard for Microsoft's
Win32 environment. Some functions from other sections of POSIX
1003.1 2001 are also supported including semaphores and scheduling
functions.

Some common non-portable functions are also implemented for
additional compatibility, as are a few functions specific
to pthreads-win32 for easier integration with Win32 applications.

Pthreads-win32 is free software, distributed under the GNU Lesser
General Public License (LGPL).


Acknowledgements
----------------
This library is based originally on a Win32 pthreads
implementation contributed by John Bossom <John.Bossom@cognos.com>.

The implementation of Condition Variables uses algorithms developed
by Alexander Terekhov and Louis Thomas.

The implementation of POSIX mutexes has been improved by Thomas Pfaff
and later by Alexander Terekhov.

The implementation of Spinlocks and Barriers was contributed
by Ross Johnson.

The implementation of read/write locks was contributed by
Aurelio Medina and improved by Alexander Terekhov.

Many others have contributed significant time and effort to solve crutial
problems in order to make the library workable, robust and reliable.

Thanks to Xavier Leroy for granting permission to use and modify his
LinuxThreads manual pages.

Thanks to The Open Group for making the Single Unix Specification
publicly available - many of the manual pages included in the package
were extracted from it.

There is also a separate CONTRIBUTORS file. This file and others are
on the web site:

As much as possible, the ChangeLog file acknowledges contributions to the
code base in more detail.

Availability
------------ 

The prebuilt DLL, export libs (for both MSVC and Mingw32), and the header
files (pthread.h, semaphore.h, sched.h) are available along with the
complete source code.

The source code can be found at:

	ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/pthreads-win32

and as individual source code files at

	ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/pthreads-win32/source

The pre-built DLL, export libraries and include files can be found at:

	ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/pthreads-win32/dll-latest


      
Mailing List 
------------  
      
There is a mailing list for discussing pthreads on Win32. To join,
send email to:

Application Development Environments
------------------------------------

See the README file for more information.
      
MSVC:
MSVC using SEH works. Distribute pthreadVSE.dll with your application.
MSVC using C++ EH works. Distribute pthreadVCE.dll with your application.
MSVC using C setjmp/longjmp works. Distribute pthreadVC.dll with your application.


Mingw32:
See the FAQ, Questions 6 and 10.

Mingw using C++ EH works. Distribute pthreadGCE.dll with your application.
Mingw using C setjmp/longjmp works. Distribute pthreadGC.dll with your application.


Cygwin: (http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/)
Developers using Cygwin do not need pthreads-win32 since it has POSIX threads
support. Refer to its documentation for details and extent.


UWIN:
UWIN is a complete Unix-like environment for Windows from AT&T. Pthreads-win32
doesn't currently support UWIN (and vice versa), but that may change in the
future.

Generally:
For convenience, the following pre-built files are available on the FTP site
(see Availability above):

	pthread.h	- for POSIX threads
	semaphore.h	- for POSIX semaphores
	sched.h 	- for POSIX scheduling
	pthreadVCE.dll	- built with MSVC++ compiler using C++ EH
	pthreadVCE.lib
	pthreadVC.dll	- built with MSVC compiler using C setjmp/longjmp
	pthreadVC.lib
	pthreadVSE.dll	- built with MSVC compiler using SEH
	pthreadVSE.lib
	pthreadGCE.dll	- built with Mingw32 G++ 2.95.2-1
	pthreadGC.dll	- built with Mingw32 GCC 2.95.2-1 using setjmp/longjmp
	libpthreadGCE.a - derived from pthreadGCE.dll
	libpthreadGC.a	- derived from pthreadGC.dll
	gcc.dll 	- needed if distributing applications that use
			  pthreadGCE.dll (but see the FAQ Q 10 for the latest
			  related information)

These are the only files you need in order to build POSIX threads
applications for Win32 using either MSVC or Mingw32.

See the FAQ file in the source tree for additional information.


Documentation
-------------

For the authoritative reference, see the online POSIX
standard reference at:

       http://www.OpenGroup.org

For POSIX Thread API programming, several reference books are
available:

       Programming with POSIX Threads
       David R. Butenhof
       Addison-Wesley (pub)

       Pthreads Programming
       By Bradford Nichols, Dick Buttlar & Jacqueline Proulx Farrell
       O'Reilly (pub)

On the web: see the links at the bottom of the pthreads-win32 site:

       http://sources.redhat.com/pthreads-win32/

       Currently, there is no documentation included in the package apart
       from the copious comments in the source code.



Enjoy!
