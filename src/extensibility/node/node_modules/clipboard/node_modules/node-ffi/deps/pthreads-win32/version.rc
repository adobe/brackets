VERSIONINFO Resource

The VERSIONINFO resource-definition statement creates a version-information
resource. The resource contains such information about the file as its
version number, its intended operating system, and its original filename.
The resource is intended to be used with the Version Information functions.

versionID VERSIONINFO fixed-info  { block-statement...}

versionID
    Version-information resource identifier. This value must be 1.

fixed-info
    Version information, such as the file version and the intended operating
    system. This parameter consists of the following statements.


    Statement 		Description
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    FILEVERSION
    version 		Binary version number for the file. The version
			consists of two 32-bit integers, defined by four
			16-bit integers. For example, "FILEVERSION 3,10,0,61"
			is translated into two doublewords: 0x0003000a and
			0x0000003d, in that order. Therefore, if version is
			defined by the DWORD values dw1 and dw2, they need
			to appear in the FILEVERSION statement as follows:
			HIWORD(dw1), LOWORD(dw1), HIWORD(dw2), LOWORD(dw2).
    PRODUCTVERSION
    version 		Binary version number for the product with which the
			file is distributed. The version parameter is two
			32-bit integers, defined by four 16-bit integers.
			For more information about version, see the
			FILEVERSION description.
    FILEFLAGSMASK
    fileflagsmask 	Bits in the FILEFLAGS statement are valid. If a bit
			is set, the corresponding bit in FILEFLAGS is valid.
    FILEFLAGSfileflags 	Attributes of the file. The fileflags parameter must
			be the combination of all the file flags that are
			valid at compile time. For 16-bit Windows, this
			value is 0x3f.
    FILEOSfileos 	Operating system for which this file was designed.
			The fileos parameter can be one of the operating
			system values given in the Remarks section.
    FILETYPEfiletype 	General type of file. The filetype parameter can be
			one of the file type values listed in the Remarks
			section.
    FILESUBTYPE
    subtype 		Function of the file. The subtype parameter is zero
			unless the type parameter in the FILETYPE statement
			is VFT_DRV, VFT_FONT, or VFT_VXD. For a list of file
			subtype values, see the Remarks section.

block-statement
    Specifies one or more version-information blocks. A block can contain
    string information or variable information. For more information, see
    StringFileInfo Block or VarFileInfo Block.

Remarks

To use the constants specified with the VERSIONINFO statement, you must
include the Winver.h or Windows.h header file in the resource-definition file.
