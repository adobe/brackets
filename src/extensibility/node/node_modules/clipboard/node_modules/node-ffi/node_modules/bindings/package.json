To make matters worse, now the _gyp_ build tool can\nproduce either a _Release_ or _Debug_ build, each being built into different\nlocations.\n\nThis module checks _all_ the possible locations that a native addon would be built\nat, and returns the first one that loads successfully.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install bindings\n```\n\nOr add it to the `\"dependencies\"` section of your _package.json_ file.\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\n`require()`ing the proper bindings file for the current node version, platform\nand architecture is as simple as:\n\n``` js\nvar bindings = require('bindings')('binding.node')\n\n// Use your bindings defined in your C files\nbindings.your_c_function()\n```\n\n\nNice Error Output\n-----------------\n\nWhen the `.node` file could not be loaded, `node-bindings` throws an Error with\na nice error message telling you exactly what was tried. You can also check the\n`err.tries` Array property.\n\n```\nError: Could not load the bindings file.
