You already know how to\n  compare strings.\n* neq(v1, v2): `v1 != v2` The opposite of eq.\n* cmp(v1, comparator, v2): Pass in a comparison string, and it'll call\n  the corresponding function above.  `\"===\"` and `\"!==\"` do simple\n  string comparison, but are included for completeness.  Throws if an\n  invalid comparison string is provided.\n* compare(v1, v2): Return 0 if v1 == v2, or 1 if v1 is greater, or -1 if\n  v2 is greater.  Sorts in ascending order if passed to Array.sort().\n* rcompare(v1, v2): The reverse of compare.  Sorts an array of versions\n  in descending order when passed to Array.sort().\n\n\n### Ranges\n\n* validRange(range): Return the valid range or null if it's not valid\n* satisfies(version, range): Return true if the version satisfies the\n  range.\n* maxSatisfying(versions, range): Return the highest version in the list\n  that satisfies the range, or null if none of them do.\n",
