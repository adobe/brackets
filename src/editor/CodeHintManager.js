/*
 * __CodeHintManager Overview:__
 *
 * The CodeHintManager mediates the interaction between the editor and a
 * collection of hint providers. If hints are requested explicitly by the
 * user, then the providers registered for the current language are queried
 * for their ability to provide hints in order of descending priority by
 * way their hasHints methods. Character insertions may also constitute an
 * implicit request for hints; consequently, providers for the current
 * language are also queried on character insertion for both their ability to
 * provide hints and also for the suitability of providing implicit hints
 * in the given editor context.
 *
 * Once a provider responds affirmatively to a request for hints, the
 * manager begins a hinting session with that provider, begins to query
 * that provider for hints by way of its getHints method, and opens the
 * hint list window. The hint list is kept open for the duration of the
 * current session. The manager maintains the session until either:
 *
 *  1. the provider gives a null response to a request for hints;
 *  2. a deferred response to getHints fails to resolve;
 *  3. the user explicitly dismisses the hint list window;
 *  4. the editor is closed or becomes inactive; or
 *  5. the editor undergoes a "complex" change, e.g., a multi-character
 *     insertion, deletion or navigation.
 *
 * Single-character insertions, deletions or navigations may not
 * invalidate the current session; in which case, each such change
 * precipitates a successive call to getHints.
 *
 * If the user selects a hint from the rendered hint list then the
 * provider is responsible for inserting the hint into the editor context
 * for the current session by way of its insertHint method. The provider
 * may use the return value of insertHint to request that an additional
 * explicit hint request be triggered, potentially beginning a new
 * session.
 *
 *
 * __CodeHintProvider Overview:__
 *
 * A code hint provider should implement the following three functions:
 *
 * - `CodeHintProvider.hasHints(editor, implicitChar)`
 * - `CodeHintProvider.getHints(implicitChar)`
 * - `CodeHintProvider.insertHint(hint)`
 *
 * The behavior of these three functions is described in detail below.
 *
 * __CodeHintProvider.hasHints(editor, implicitChar)__
 *
 * The method by which a provider indicates intent to provide hints for a
 * given editor. The manager calls this method both when hints are
 * explicitly requested (via, e.g., Ctrl-Space) and when they may be
 * implicitly requested as a result of character insertion in the editor.
 * If the provider responds negatively then the manager may query other
 * providers for hints. Otherwise, a new hinting session begins with this
 * provider, during which the manager may repeatedly query the provider
 * for hints via the getHints method. Note that no other providers will be
 * queried until the hinting session ends.
 *
 * The implicitChar parameter is used to determine whether the hinting
 * request is explicit or implicit. If the string is null then hints were
 * explicitly requested and the provider should reply based on whether it
 * is possible to return hints for the given editor context. Otherwise,
 * the string contains just the last character inserted into the editor's
 * document and the request for hints is implicit. In this case, the
 * provider should determine whether it is both possible and appropriate
 * to show hints. Because implicit hints can be triggered by every
 * character insertion, hasHints may be called frequently; consequently,
 * the provider should endeavor to return a value as quickly as possible.
 *
 * Because calls to hasHints imply that a hinting session is about to
 * begin, a provider may wish to clean up cached data from previous
 * sessions in this method. Similarly, if the provider returns true, it
 * may wish to prepare to cache data suitable for the current session. In
 * particular, it should keep a reference to the editor object so that it
 * can access the editor in future calls to getHints and insertHints.
 *
 * param {Editor} editor
 * A non-null editor object for the active window.
 *
 * param {string} implicitChar
 * Either null, if the hinting request was explicit, or a single character
 * that represents the last insertion and that indicates an implicit
 * hinting request.
 *
 * return {boolean}
 * Determines whether the current provider is able to provide hints for
 * the given editor context and, in case implicitChar is non- null,
 * whether it is appropriate to do so.
 *
 *
 * __CodeHintProvider.getHints(implicitChar)__
 *
 * The method by which a provider provides hints for the editor context
 * associated with the current session. The getHints method is called only
 * if the provider asserted its willingness to provide hints in an earlier
 * call to hasHints. The provider may return null or false, which indicates
 * that the manager should end the current hinting session and close the hint
 * list window; or true, which indicates that the manager should end the
 * current hinting session but immediately attempt to begin a new hinting
 * session by querying registered providers. Otherwise, the provider should
 * return a response object that contains the following properties:
 *
 *  1. hints, a sorted array hints that the provider could later insert
 *     into the editor;
 *  2. match, a string that the manager may use to emphasize substrings of
 *     hints in the hint list (case-insensitive); and
 *  3. selectInitial, a boolean that indicates whether or not the
 *     first hint in the list should be selected by default.
 *  4. handleWideResults, a boolean (or undefined) that indicates whether
 *     to allow result string to stretch width of display.
 *
 * If the array of
 * hints is empty, then the manager will render an empty list, but the
 * hinting session will remain open and the value of the selectInitial
 * property is irrelevant.
 *
 * Alternatively, the provider may return a jQuery.Deferred object
 * that resolves with an object with the structure described above. In
 * this case, the manager will initially render the hint list window with
 * a throbber and will render the actual list once the deferred object
 * resolves to a response object. If a hint list has already been rendered
 * (from an earlier call to getHints), then the old list will continue
 * to be displayed until the new deferred has resolved.
 *
 * Both the manager and the provider can reject the deferred object. The
 * manager will reject the deferred if the editor changes state (e.g., the
 * user types a character) or if the hinting session ends (e.g., the user
 * explicitly closes the hints by pressing escape). The provider can use
 * this event to, e.g., abort an expensive computation. Consequently, the
 * provider may assume that getHints will not be called again until the
 * deferred object from the current call has resolved or been rejected. If
 * the provider rejects the deferred, the manager will end the hinting
 * session.
 *
 * The getHints method may be called by the manager repeatedly during a
 * hinting session. Providers may wish to cache information for efficiency
 * that may be useful throughout these sessions. The same editor context
 * will be used throughout a session, and will only change during the
 * session as a result of single-character insertions, deletions and
 * cursor navigations. The provider may assume that, throughout the
 * lifetime of the session, the getHints method will be called exactly
 * once for each such editor change. Consequently, the provider may also
 * assume that the document will not be changed outside of the editor
 * during a session.
 *
 * param {string} implicitChar
 * Either null, if the request to update the hint list was a result of
 * navigation, or a single character that represents the last insertion.
 *
 *     return {jQuery.Deferred|{
 *          hints: Array.<string|jQueryObject>,
 *          match: string,
 *          selectInitial: boolean,
 *          handleWideResults: boolean}}
 *
 * Null if the provider wishes to end the hinting session. Otherwise, a
 * response object, possibly deferred, that provides 1. a sorted array
 * hints that consists either of strings or jQuery objects; 2. a string
 * match, possibly null, that is used by the manager to emphasize
 * matching substrings when rendering the hint list; and 3. a boolean that
 * indicates whether the first result, if one exists, should be selected
 * by default in the hint list window. If match is non-null, then the
 * hints should be strings.
 *
 * If the match is null, the manager will not
 * attempt to emphasize any parts of the hints when rendering the hint
 * list; instead the provider may return strings or jQuery objects for
 * which emphasis is self-contained. For example, the strings may contain
 * substrings that wrapped in bold tags. In this way, the provider can
 * choose to let the manager handle emphasis for the simple and common case
 * of prefix matching, or can provide its own emphasis if it wishes to use
 * a more sophisticated matching algorithm.
 *
 *
 * __CodeHintProvider.insertHint(hint)__
 *
 * The method by which a provider inserts a hint into the editor context
 * associated with the current session. The provider may assume that the
 * given hint was returned by the provider in some previous call in the
 * current session to getHints, but not necessarily the most recent call.
 * After the insertion has been performed, the current hinting session is
 * closed. The provider should return a boolean value to indicate whether
 * or not the end of the session should be immediately followed by a new
 * explicit hinting request, which may result in a new hinting session
 * being opened with some provider, but not necessarily the current one.
 *
 * param {string} hint
 * The hint to be inserted into the editor context for the current session.
 *
 * return {boolean}
 * Indicates whether the manager should follow hint insertion with an
 * explicit hint request.
 *
 *
 * __CodeHintProvider.insertHintOnTab__
 *
 * type {?boolean} insertHintOnTab
 * Indicates whether the CodeHintManager should request that the provider of
 * the current session insert the currently selected hint on tab key events,
 * or if instead a tab character should be inserted into the editor. If omitted,
 * the fallback behavior is determined by the CodeHintManager. The default
 * behavior is to insert a tab character, but this can be changed with the
 * insertHintOnTab Preference.
