# Brackets Dev Extensions

This directory contains extensions that are being developed. User-installed
extensions are placed in the "user" extensions directory, which can be accessed
by running the <code>Help > Show Extensions Folder</code> menu command. The contents of
this directory (except the <code>README.md</code> file) are ignored by git.

(<code>README.md</code> also serves as a dummy file so this directory can be added to git.)
