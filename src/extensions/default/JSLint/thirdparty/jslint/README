jslint.js contains the fully commented global JSLINT function.

jslint.html runs the JSLINT function in a web page. The page also depends
on adsafe.js [www.ADsafe.org] and json2.js [www.JSON.org] (which are not
included in this project) and intercept.js and init_ui.js (which are). The
js files should all be minified, and all except init_ui.js are concatenated
together to form web_jslint.js.

adsafe.js       https://github.com/douglascrockford/ADsafe
json2.js        https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js

intercept.js augments ADsafe, giving widgets access to the clock, cookies,
and the JSLINT function.

init_ui.js hooks the HTML ui components to ADsafe.

lint.html describes JSLint's usage. Please read it.

JSLint can be run anywhere that JavaScript (or Java) can run. See for example

The place to express yourself in programming is in the quality of your ideas,
and the efficiency of execution. The role of style is the same as in
literature. A great writer doesn't express himself by putting the spaces
before his commas instead of after, or by putting extra spaces inside his
parentheses. A great writer will slavishly conform to some rules of style,
and that in no way constrains his power to express himself creatively.
See for example William Strunk's The Elements of Style
[http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/style.html].

This applies to programming as well. Conforming to a consistent style
improves readability, and frees you to express yourself in ways that matter.
JSLint here plays the part of a stern but benevolent editor, helping you to
get the style right so that you can focus your creative energy where it is
most needed.
