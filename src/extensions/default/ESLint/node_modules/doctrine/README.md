# Doctrine

Doctrine is a [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org) parser that parses documentation comments from JavaScript (you need to pass in the comment, not a whole JavaScript file).

## Installation

You can install Doctrine using [npm](https://npmjs.com):

```
$ npm install doctrine --save-dev
```

Doctrine can also be used in web browsers using [Browserify](http://browserify.org).

## Usage

Require doctrine inside of your JavaScript:

```js
var doctrine = require("doctrine");
```

### parse()

The primary method is `parse()`, which accepts two arguments: the JSDoc comment to parse and an optional options object. The available options are:

* `unwrap` - set to `true` to delete the leading `/**`, any `*` that begins a line, and the trailing `*/` from the source text. Default: `false`.
* `tags` - an array of tags to return. When specified, Doctrine returns only tags in this array. For example, if `tags` is `["param"]`, then only `@param` tags will be returned. Default: `null`.
* `recoverable` - set to `true` to keep parsing even when syntax errors occur. Default: `false`.
* `sloppy` - set to `true` to allow optional parameters to be specified in brackets (`@param {string} [foo]`). Default: `false`.
* `lineNumberes` - set to `true` to add `lineNumber` to each node, specifying the line on which the node is found in the source. Default: `false`.

Here's a simple example:

```js
var ast = doctrine.parse(
    [
        "/**",
        " * This function comment is parsed by doctrine",
        " * @param {{ok:String}} userName",
        "*/"
    ].join('\n'), { unwrap: true });
```

This example returns the following AST:

    {
        "description": "This function comment is parsed by doctrine",
        "tags": [
            {
                "title": "param",
                "description": null,
                "type": {
                    "type": "RecordType",
                    "fields": [
                        {
                            "type": "FieldType",
                            "key": "ok",
                            "value": {
                                "type": "NameExpression",
                                "name": "String"
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                },
                "name": "userName"
            }
        ]
    }

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I pass a whole JavaScript file to Doctrine?

No. Doctrine can only parse JSDoc comments, so you'll need to pass just the JSDoc comment to Doctrine in order to work.
