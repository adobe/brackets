 * Brackets Default Theme
 *
 * Defines all the variables that one can configure in a theme. This should
 * contain all variables / mixins for UI styling that we want to be able to
 * change in a theme.
 *
 * Throughout the rest of the LESS files we should _only_ use color
 * variable names that are on the LHS of the list below. So, if we
 * need a new color for some UI element, we should add a variable
 * in this file.
