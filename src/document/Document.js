     * Model for the contents of a single file and its current modification state.
     * See DocumentManager documentation for important usage notes.
     *
     * Document dispatches these events:
     *
     * __change__ -- When the text of the editor changes (including due to undo/redo). 
     *
     * Passes ({Document}, {ChangeList}), where ChangeList is an array
     * of change record objects. Each change record looks like:
     *
     *     { from: start of change, expressed as {line: <line number>, ch: <character offset>},
     *       to: end of change, expressed as {line: <line number>, ch: <chracter offset>},
     *       text: array of lines of text to replace existing text }
     *      
     * The line and ch offsets are both 0-based.
     *
     * The ch offset in "from" is inclusive, but the ch offset in "to" is exclusive. For example,
     * an insertion of new content (without replacing existing content) is expressed by a range
     * where from and to are the same.
     *
     * If "from" and "to" are undefined, then this is a replacement of the entire text content.
     *
     * IMPORTANT: If you listen for the "change" event, you MUST also addRef() the document 
     * (and releaseRef() it whenever you stop listening). You should also listen to the "deleted"
     * event.
     *
     * __deleted__ -- When the file for this document has been deleted. All views onto the document should
     * be closed. The document will no longer be editable or dispatch "change" events.
     * 
     * __languageChanged__ -- When the value of getLanguage() has changed. 2nd argument is the old value,
     * 3rd argument is the new value.

    /**
     * Helper function for edit operations that operate on multiple selections. Takes an "edit list"
     * that specifies a list of replaceRanges that should occur, but where all the positions are with
     * respect to the document state before all the edits (i.e., you don't have to figure out how to fix
     * up the selections after each sub-edit). Edits must be non-overlapping (in original-document terms).
     * All the edits are done in a single batch.
     *
     * If your edits are structured in such a way that each individual edit would cause its associated
     * selection to be properly updated, then all you need to specify are the edits themselves, and the
     * selections will automatically be updated as the edits are performed. However, for some
     * kinds of edits, you need to fix up the selection afterwards. In that case, you can specify one
     * or more selections to be associated with each edit. Those selections are assumed to be in terms
     * of the document state after the edit, *as if* that edit were the only one being performed (i.e.,
     * you don't have to worry about adjusting for the effect of other edits). If you supply these selections,
     * then this function will adjust them as necessary for the effects of other edits, and then return a
     * flat list of all the selections, suitable for passing to `setSelections()`.
     *
     * @param {!Array.<{edit: {text: string, start:{line: number, ch: number}, end:?{line: number, ch: number}}
     *                        | Array.<{text: string, start:{line: number, ch: number}, end:?{line: number, ch: number}}>,
     *                  selection: ?{start:{line:number, ch:number}, end:{line:number, ch:number}, 
     *                              primary:boolean, reversed: boolean, isBeforeEdit: boolean}>}
     *                        | ?Array.<{start:{line:number, ch:number}, end:{line:number, ch:number}, 
     *                                  primary:boolean, reversed: boolean, isBeforeEdit: boolean}>}>} edits
     *     Specifies the list of edits to perform in a manner similar to CodeMirror's `replaceRange`. This array
     *     will be mutated.
     *
     *     `edit` is the edit to perform:
     *         `text` will replace the current contents of the range between `start` and `end`. 
     *         If `end` is unspecified, the text is inserted at `start`.
     *         `start` and `end` should be positions relative to the document *ignoring* all other edit descriptions
     *         (i.e., as if you were only performing this one edit on the document).
     *     If any of the edits overlap, an error will be thrown.
     *
     *     If `selection` is specified, it should be a selection associated with this edit.
     *          If `isBeforeEdit` is set on the selection, the selection will be fixed up for this edit.
     *          If not, it won't be fixed up for this edit, meaning it should be expressed in terms of
     *          the document state after this individual edit is performed (ignoring any other edits).
     *          Note that if you were planning on just specifying `isBeforeEdit` for every selection, you can
     *          accomplish the same thing by simply not passing any selections and letting the editor update
     *          the existing selections automatically.
     *
     *     Note that `edit` and `selection` can each be either an individual edit/selection, or a group of
     *     edits/selections to apply in order. This can be useful if you need to perform multiple edits in a row
     *     and then specify a resulting selection that shouldn't be fixed up for any of those edits (but should be
     *     fixed up for edits related to other selections). It can also be useful if you have several selections
     *     that should ignore the effects of a given edit because you've fixed them up already (this commonly happens
     *     with line-oriented edits where multiple cursors on the same line should be ignored, but still tracked). 
     *     Within an edit group, edit positions must be specified relative to previous edits within that group. Also,
     *     the total bounds of edit groups must not overlap (e.g. edits in one group can't surround an edit from another group).
     *
     * @param {?string} origin An optional edit origin that's passed through to each replaceRange().
     * @return {Array<{start:{line:number, ch:number}, end:{line:number, ch:number}, primary:boolean, reversed: boolean}>}
     *     The list of passed selections adjusted for the performed edits, if any.
