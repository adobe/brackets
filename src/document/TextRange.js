     * Stores a range of lines that is automatically maintained as the Document changes. The range
     * MAY drop out of sync with the Document in certain edge cases; startLine & endLine will become
     * null when that happens.
     *
     * Important: you must dispose() a TextRange when you're done with it. Because TextRange addRef()s
     * the Document (in order to listen to it), you will leak Documents otherwise.
     *
     * TextRange dispatches these events:
     *  - change -- When the range boundary line numbers change (due to a Document change)
     *  - contentChange -- When the actual content of the range changes. This might or might not
     *    be accompanied by a change in the boundary line numbers.
     *  - lostSync -- When the backing Document changes in such a way that the range can no longer
     *    accurately be maintained. Generally, occurs whenever an edit spans a range boundary.
     *    After this, startLine & endLine will be unusable (set to null).
     *    Also occurs when the document is deleted, though startLine & endLine won't be modified
     * These events only ever occur in response to Document changes, so if you are already listening
     * to the Document, you could ignore the TextRange events and just read its updated value in your
     * own Document change handler.
