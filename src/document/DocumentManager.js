/**
 * DocumentManager maintains a list of currently 'open' Documents. The DocumentManager is responsible 
 * manifesting documents into the editor, closing documents, coordinating document operations and 
 * dispatching certain document events.
 *
 * Document is the model for a file's contents; it dispatches events whenever those contents change.
 * To transiently inspect a file's content, simply get a Document and call getText() on it. However,
 * to be notified of Document changes or to modify a Document, you MUST call addRef() to ensure the
 * Document instance 'stays alive' and is shared by all other who read/modify that file. ('Open'
 * Documents are all Documents that are 'kept alive', i.e. have ref count > 0).
 *
 * To get a Document, call getDocumentForPath(); never new up a Document yourself.
 *
 * Secretly, a Document may use an Editor instance to act as the model for its internal state. (This
 * is unavoidable because CodeMirror does not separate its model from its UI). Documents are not
 * modifiable until they have a backing 'master Editor'. Creation of the backing Editor is owned by
 * EditorManager. A Document only gets a backing Editor if it becomes the currentDocument, or if edits
 * occur in any Editor (inline or full-sized) bound to the Document; there is currently no other way
 * to ensure a Document is modifiable.
 *
 * A non-modifiable Document may still dispatch change notifications, if the Document was changed
 * externally on disk.
 *
 * Aside from the text content, Document tracks a few pieces of metadata - notably, whether there are
 * any unsaved changes.
 *
 * This module dispatches several events:
 *
 *    - dirtyFlagChange -- When any Document's isDirty flag changes. The 2nd arg to the listener is the
 *      Document whose flag changed.
 *    - documentSaved -- When a Document's changes have been saved. The 2nd arg to the listener is the
 *      Document that has been saved.
 *    - documentRefreshed -- When a Document's contents have been reloaded from disk. The 2nd arg to the
 *      listener is the Document that has been refreshed.
 * 
 * NOTE: WorkingSet APIs have been deprecated and have moved to MainViewManager as PaneViewList APIs
 *       Some WorkingSet APIs that have been identified as being used by 3rd party extensions will
 *       emit deprecation warnings and call the PaneViewList APIS to maintain backwards compatibility
 *
 *    - currentDocumentChange -- This is being deprecated and is currently ony used as a shim to assist 
 *      the document open process so that the editor will actually open or close the desired document. 
 *      This will change accordingly once work begins to refactor EditorManager to be a view provider
 *      and open documents directly.
 *
 *    - fileNameChange -- When the name of a file or folder has changed. The 2nd arg is the old name.
 *      The 3rd arg is the new name.
 *    - pathDeleted -- When a file or folder has been deleted. The 2nd arg is the path that was deleted.
 *
 * These are jQuery events, so to listen for them you do something like this:
 *    $(DocumentManager).on("eventname", handler);
 *
 * Document objects themselves also dispatch some events - see Document docs for details.
