/**
 * DocumentManager maintains a list of currently 'open' Documents. It also owns the list of files in
 * the working set, and the notion of which Document is currently shown in the main editor UI area.
 * 
 * Document is the model for a file's contents; it dispatches events whenever those contents change.
 * To transiently inspect a file's content, simply get a Document and call getText() on it. However,
 * to be notified of Document changes or to modify a Document, you MUST call addRef() to ensure the
 * Document instance 'stays alive' and is shared by all other who read/modify that file. ('Open'
 * Documents are all Documents that are 'kept alive', i.e. have ref count > 0).
 *
 * To get a Document, call getDocumentForPath(); never new up a Document yourself.
 * 
 * Secretly, a Document may use an Editor instance to act as the model for its internal state. (This
 * is unavoidable because CodeMirror does not separate its model from its UI). Documents are not
 * modifiable until they have a backing 'master Editor'. Creation of the backing Editor is owned by
 * EditorManager. A Document only gets a backing Editor if it becomes the currentDocument, or if edits
 * occur in any Editor (inline or full-sized) bound to the Document; there is currently no other way
 * to ensure a Document is modifiable.
 *
 * A non-modifiable Document may still dispatch change notifications, if the Document was changed
 * externally on disk.
 *
 * Aside from the text content, Document tracks a few pieces of metadata - notably, whether there are
 * any unsaved changes.
 *
 * This module dispatches several events:
 *    - dirtyFlagChange -- When any Document's isDirty flag changes. The 2nd arg to the listener is the
 *      Document whose flag changed.
 *    - documentSaved -- When a Document's changes have been saved. The 2nd arg to the listener is the 
 *      Document that has been saved.
 *    - currentDocumentChange -- When the value of getCurrentDocument() changes.
 *    - workingSetAdd -- When a file is added to the working set (see getWorkingSet()). The 2nd arg
 *      to the listener is the added FileEntry.
 *    - workingSetRemove -- When a file is removed from the working set (see getWorkingSet()). The
 *      2nd arg to the listener is the removed FileEntry.
 *
 * These are jQuery events, so to listen for them you do something like this:
 *    $(DocumentManager).on("eventname", handler);

     *            { from: start of change, expressed as {line: <line number>, ch: <character offset>},
     *              to: end of change, expressed as {line: <line number>, ch: <chracter offset>},
     *              text: array of lines of text to replace existing text,

     *      
     *        The line and ch offsets are both 0-based.
     *
     *        The ch offset in "from" is inclusive, but the ch offset in "to" is exclusive. For example,
     *        an insertion of new content (without replacing existing content) is expressed by a range
     *        where from and to are the same.
     *
     *        If "from" and "to" are undefined, then this is a replacement of the entire text content.

     *        IMPORTANT: If you listen for the "change" event, you MUST also addRef() the document 
     *        (and releaseRef() it whenever you stop listening). You should also listen to the "deleted"
     *        event.
