/**
 * FileSyncManager is a set of utilities to help track external modifications to the files and folders
 * in the currently open project.
 *
 * Currently, we detect external changes purely by checking file timestamps against the last-sync
 * timestamp recorded on Document. Brackets triggers this check whenever an external change was detected
 * by our native file watchers, and on window focus. We recheck all open Documents, but with file caching
 * the timestamp check is a fast no-op for everything other than files where a watcher change was just
 * notified. If watchers/caching are disabled, we'll essentially check only on window focus, and we'll hit
 * the disk to check every open Document's timestamp every time.
 *
 * FUTURE: Whenever we have a 'project file tree model,' we should manipulate that instead of notifying
 * DocumentManager directly. DocumentManager, the tree UI, etc. then all listen to that model for changes.
