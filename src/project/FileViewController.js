/**
 * Responsible for coordinating file selection between views by permitting only one view
 * to show the current file selection at a time. Currently, only WorkingSetView and 
 * ProjectManager can show file selection. In general the WorkingSetView takes higher
 * priority until the user selects a file in the ProjectManager.
 *
 * Current file selection rules in views:
 * - select a file in WorkingSetView > select in WorkingSetView
 * - add a file to the WorkingSetView > select in WorkingSetView
 * - select a file in ProjectManager > select in ProjectManager
 * - open a file from places other than the WorkingSetView or ProjectManager > 
 *       select file in WorkignSetView if its in the working set, otherwise select in ProjectManager
