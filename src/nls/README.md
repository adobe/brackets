# How to add translations for a *new* locale

1. Create a subfolder of the `nls` folder whose name is the language or locale you want to
   create a translation for.
    * If you're creating a general translation for a language, just use its two-letter code
      (e.g. `en`, `de`).
    * If you're creating a locale-specific translation for a particular country, add a hyphen
      and the country code in lowercase (e.g. `en-ca`, `en-gb`).
2. Add an entry for your translation to the `module.exports` object in `nls/strings.js`.
3. Edit the root `strings-app.js` file and add a new `LOCALE_`* entry for your language, as seen in
   the Debug > Switch Language UI.
4. Copy the root `strings.js` file into your subfolder and start translating!
5. Use the [UI walkthrough steps](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Localization-Tests) to
   see strings in context.
6. Add this comment ``/* Last translated for SHA_of_root_strings.js */`` at the end 
   of your `strings.js` and replace `SHA_of_root_strings.js` with the actual SHA. You can 
   copy the actual SHA in this [history page](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/commits/master/src/nls/root/strings.js)
   by hovering on the one you used for this translation and click on Copy SHA button.
7. Edit this file and update the list of languages below!

Strings not specified in a given locale will fall back to the general language (without hyphen)
first, and then will fall back to the English string from `nls/root/strings.js`.

Localization is provided via the [require.js i18n plugin](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#i18n).

### Translating the Getting Started project

When first installed, Brackets will open a Getting Started project that serves
as an introduction to Brackets features. This project can be translated by
providing a ``urls.js`` file that points to a localized directory under the
``samples`` folder at the root of the Brackets repository. See the French
localization (`src/nls/fr/urls.js`) for an example.


# How to modify *existing* translations

### Adobe-maintained translations

Adobe provides translations for the following languages:

* French (fr)
* Japanese (ja)

These translations cannot be modified through our normal pull request
process. Please contribute changes one of these ways:

1. File an issue in our GitHub repository
   https://github.com/adobe/brackets/issues
2. Submit a proposal at the AdobeÂ® Translation Center (ATC), [under the Brackets
   product](http://bit.ly/TranslateBrackets). At ATC, proposals can be voted on
   by peers and are eventually accepted by moderators.

### Community-maintained translations

The following languages have been contributed by the Brackets community:

* Czech (cs)
* German (de)
* Greek (el)
* Spanish (es)
* Persian-Farsi (fa-ir)
* Finnish (fi)
* Croatian (hr)
* Hungarian (hu)
* Italian (it)
* Korean (ko)
* Norwegian (nb)
* Dutch (nl)
* Polish (pl)
* Brazilian Portuguese (pt-br)
* Portuguese (pt-pt)
* Romanian (ro)
* Russian (ru)
* Slovak (sk)
* Serbian (sr)
* Swedish (sv)
* Turkish (tr)
* Simplified Chinese (zh-cn)
* Indonesia (id)

These translations _can be directly modified_ through our normal pull request
process. Make sure that you also update the comment on the last line with the 
correct SHA of `strings.js` from root directory, which you used for your translation.
If the SHA comment is missing, then add one with the correct SHA. See step 6 in 
__How to add translations for a *new* locale__ section for adding a new one.

In the future, Adobe may begin maintaining some of these languages too, at which
point the process will switch to the one above. But until then, please _do not
use_ http://translate.adobe.com for these languages.


# Translation limitations

Some strings cannot be localized yet:

* [Keyboard shortcuts](https://trello.com/c/4k2yalBd)
* [Some native menus on Mac](https://trello.com/c/0IsE7q02) (hardcoded support only for English, French, Japanese)
* Windows installer UI (hardcoded support only for English, Japanese - with some limitations)
