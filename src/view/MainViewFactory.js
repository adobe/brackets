/**
 * MainViewFactory is a singleton for managing view factories.
 *
 * Registering a view factory:
 *
 *      registerViewFactory({
 *           canOpen: function (fullPath) {
 *               return (fullPath.slice(-4) === ".ico");
 *           },
 *           open: function(file, pane) {
 *               return createIconView(file, pane);
 *           }
 *      });
 *
 *  The open method is used to open the file and construct
 *  a view of it.  Implementation should add the view to the pane
 *
 *      function createIconView(file, pane) {
 *          // IconView will construct its DOM and append 
 *          //  it to pane.$el
 *          var view = new IconView(file, pane.$el);
 *          // Then tell the pane to add it to
 *          //  its view map and show it
 *          pane.addView(view, true); 
 *          return new $.Deferred().resolve().promise();
 *      }
 *
 *  Factories should only create 1 view of a file per pane.  Brackets currently only supports 1 view of 
 *  a file open at a given time but that may change to allow the same file open in more than 1 pane. Therefore
 *  Factories can do a simple check to see if a view already exists and show it before creating a new one:
 *
 *      var view = pane.getViewForPath(file.fullPath);
 *      if (view) {
 *          pane.showView(view);
 *      } else {
 *          return createIconView(file, pane);
 *      }
 *
