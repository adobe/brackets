/**
 * Provides the protocol that Brackets uses to talk to a browser instance for live development.
 * Protocol methods are converted to a JSON message format, which is then sent over a provided
 * low-level transport and interpreted in the browser. For messages that expect a response, the
 * response is returned through a promise as an object. Scripts that implement remote logic are
 * provided during the instrumentation stage by "getRemoteFunctions()".
 *
 * Events raised by the remote browser are dispatched as jQuery events which type is equal to the 'method' 
 * property. The received message object is dispatched as the first parameter and enriched with a 
 * 'clientId' property being the client ID of the remote browser.
 *
 * It keeps active connections which are  updated when receiving "connect" and "close" from the 
 * underlying transport. Events "Connection.connect"/"Connection.close" are triggered as 
 * propagation of transport's "connect"/"close".
 *
