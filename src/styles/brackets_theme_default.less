/* Code font formatting
 *
 * NOTE (JRB): At this time, the font-family must be set in .code-font (not in one of the platform-specific versions).
 * This is because, in order to get the web font to load early enough, we have a div called "dummy-text" that
 * is styled with .code-font().
 *
 * The platform-specific selector gets added to the body tag at document ready time, so it may not happen soon
 * enough to get the web font loaded. So, we can't rely on this selector to load web fonts in a platform-specific way
 *
 * An alternative (if we wanted platform-specific fonts) would be to have a dummy text div for EVERY web font, and
 * then style those dummy text divs directly in brackets_fonts.less. However, this would result in us downloading
 * all fonts for every platform. This probably isn't a huge performance problem, but isn't necessary at this time.
