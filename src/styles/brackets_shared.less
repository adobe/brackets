/* Shared LESS for all versions of Brackets (e.g. App, In-Browser, etc.)
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Importing this file should be the first step in creating a
 * version-specific LESS file.
 *
 * ALSO IMPORTANT: All CSS imports should occur first in this file. This is
 * because LESS puts all CSS imports at the top of the file anyway (because
 * this is required by CSS2). So, we don't want to be misleading about the
 * processing order.
