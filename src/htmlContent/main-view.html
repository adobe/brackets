<!--
    HTML template for the body tag of index.html. It is rendered dynamically in
    brackets.js with Mustache and localized with the i18n RequireJS plugin.

    LOCALIZATION NOTE:
    All display text for this file must use templating so the text can be localized.
    
    English text goes in src/nls/root/strings.js. All other translations go in the strings.js file for
    the specific local in the nls folder. If a translation is missing for a specific key English
    is used as a fallback

    Strings should be referenced using the double brackets syntax.
    Example: {{keyname}}. Note, all strings are HTML escaped unless the form 
    {{&keyname}} is used.

            Note: all children must be in a vertical stack with heights explicitly set in a fixed
                unit such as px (not percent/em/auto). If you change the height later, you must
                call EditorManager.resizeEditor() each time. Otherwise editor-holder's height will
                not get set correctly. Use PanelManager to have this managed for you automatically.
