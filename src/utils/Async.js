    // Further ideas for Async utilities...
    //  - Utilities for blocking UI until a Promise completes?
    //  - A "SuperDeferred" could feature some very useful enhancements:
    //     - API for cancellation (non guaranteed, best attempt)
    //     - Easier way to add a timeout clause (withTimeout() wrapper below is more verbose)
    //     - Encapsulate the task kickoff code so you can start it later, e.g. superDeferred.start()
    //  - Deferred/Promise are unable to do anything akin to a 'finally' block. It'd be nice if we
    //    could harvest exceptions across all steps of an async process and pipe them to a handler,
    //    so that we don't leave UI-blocking overlays up forever, etc. But this is hard: we'd have
    //    wrap every async callback (including low-level native ones that don't use [Super]Deferred)
    //    to catch exceptions, and then understand which Deferred(s) the code *would* have resolved/
    //    rejected had it run to completion.
