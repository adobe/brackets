 * Defines hooks to assist with module initialization.

 * This module defines 2 methods for client modules to attach callbacks:
 *    - htmlReady - When the main application template is rendered
 *    - extensionsRead - When the extension manager has loaded all extensions
 *    - appReady - When Brackets completes loading all modules and extensions
 *
 * These are *not* jQuery events. Each method is similar to $(document).ready
 * in that it will call the handler immediately if brackets is already done
 * loading.
