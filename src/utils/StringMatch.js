     * Finds the best matches between the query and the string. The query is
     * compared with str (usually a lower case string with a lower case
     * query).
     *
     * Generally speaking, this function tries to find "special" characters
     * (see findSpecialCharacters above) first. Failing that, it starts scanning
     * the "normal" characters. Sometimes, it will find a special character that matches
     * but then not be able to match the rest of the query. In cases like that, the
     * search will backtrack and try to find matches for the whole query earlier in the
     * string.
     *
     * A contrived example will help illustrate how the searching and backtracking works. It's a bit long,
     * but it illustrates different pieces of the algorithm which can be tricky. Let's say that we're
     * searching the string "AzzBzzCzdzezzDgxgEF" for "abcdex".
     *
     * To start with, it will match "abcde" from the query to "A B C D E" in the string (the spaces 
     * represent gaps in the matched part of the string), because those are all "special characters".
     * However, the "x" in the query doesn't match the "F" which is the only character left in the
     * string.
     * 
     * Backtracking kicks in. The "E" is pulled off of the match list.
     * deadBranches[4] is set to the "g" before the "E". This means that for the 5th
     * query character (the "e") we know that we don't have a match beyond that point in the string.
     *
     * To resume searching, the backtrack function looks at the previous match (the "D") and starts
     * searching in character-by-character (ANY_MATCH) mode right after that. It fails to find an
     * "e" before it gets to deadBranches[4], so it has to backtrack again.
     *
     * This time, the "D" is pulled off the match list.
     * deadBranches[3] is set to the "z" before the "D", because we know that for the "dex" part of the
     * query, we can't make it work past the "D". We'll resume searching with the "z" after the "C".
     *
     * Doing an ANY_MATCH search, we find the "d". We then start searching specials for "e", but we
     * stop before we get to "E" because deadBranches[4] tells us that's a dead end. So, we switch
     * to ANY_MATCH and find the "e".
     *
     * Finally, we search for the "x". We don't find a special that matches, so we start an ANY_MATCH
     * search. Then we find the "x", and we have a successful match.
     *
     * Here are some notes on how the algorithm works:
     *
     * * We only backtrack() when we're exhausted both special AND normal forward searches past that point, 
     *   for the query remainder we currently have.  For a different query remainder, we may well get further 
     *   along - hence deadBranches[] being dependent on queryCounter; but in order to get a different query 
     *   remainder, we must give up one or more current matches by backtracking.
     *
     * * Normal "any char" forward search is a superset of special matching mode -- anything that would have 
     *   been matched in special mode *could* also be matched by normal mode. In practice, however,
     *   any special characters that could have matched would be picked up first by the specials matching
     *   code.
     *
     * * backtrack() always goes at least as far back as str[deadBranches[queryCounter]-1] before allowing 
     *   forward searching to resume
     *
     * * When `deadBranches[queryCounter] = strCounter` it means if we're still trying to match 
     *   `queryLower[queryCounter]` and we get to `str[strCounter]`, there's no way we can match the 
     *   remainer of `queryLower` with the remainder of `str` -- either using specials-only or 
     *   full any-char matching.
     *
     * * We know this because deadBranches[] is set in backtrack(), and we don't get to backtrack() unless 
     *   either:
     *   1. We've already exhausted both special AND normal forward searches past that point
     *      (i.e. backtrack() due to `strCounter >= str.length`, yet `queryCounter < query.length`)
     *   2. We stopped searching further forward due to a previously set deadBranches[] value
     *      (i.e. backtrack() due to `strCounter > deadBranches[queryCounter]`, yet 
     *      `queryCounter < query.length`)
     *
     * @param {string} query the search string (generally lower cased)
     * @param {string} str the string to compare with (generally lower cased)
