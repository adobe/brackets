 * NOTE: The fsevents package is a temporary solution for file-watching on darwin.
 * Node's native fs.watch call would be preferable, but currently has a hard limit
 * of 451 watched directories and fails silently after that! In the next stable
 * version of Node (0.12), fs.watch on darwin will support a new "recursive" option
 * that will allow us to only request a single watched path per directory structure.
 * When that is stable, we should switch back to fs.watch for all platforms, and
 * we should use the recursive option where available. As of January 2014, the
 * current experimental Node branch (0.11) only supports the recursive option for
 * darwin.
 * 
 * In the meantime, the fsevents package makes direct use of the Mac OS fsevents
 * API to provide file watching capabilities. Its behavior is also recursive
 * (like fs.watch with the recursive option), but the events it emits are not
 * exactly the same as those emitted by Node watchers. Consequently, we require,
 * for now, dual implementations of the FileWatcher domain. 
 * 
 * ALSO NOTE: the fsevents package as installed by NPM is not suitable for
 * distribution with Brackets! The problem is that the native code embedded in
 * the fsevents module is compiled by default for x86-64, but the Brackets-node
 * process is compiled for x86-32. Consequently, the fsevents module must be
 * compiled manually, which is why it is checked into Brackets source control
 * and not managed by NPM. Changing compilation from 64- to 32-bit just requires
 * changing a couple of definitions in the .gyp file used to build fsevents.
