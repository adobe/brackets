/**
 * DocumentManager is the model for the set of currently 'open' files and their contents. It controls
 * which file is currently shown in the editor, the dirty bit for all files, and the list of documents
 * in the working set.
 * 
 * Each Document also encapsulates the editor widget for that file, which in turn controls each file's
 * contents and undo history. (So this is not a perfectly clean, headless model, but that's unavoidable
 * because the document state is tied up in the CodeMirror UI). We share ownership of the editor objects
 * with EditorManager, which creates, shows/hides, resizes, and disposes the editors.
 *
 * This module dispatches several events:
 *    - dirtyFlagChange -- When any Document's isDirty flag changes. The 2nd arg to the listener is the
 *      Document whose flag changed.
 *    - currentDocumentChange -- When the value of getCurrentDocument() changes.
 *    - workingSetAdd -- When a Document is added to the working set (see getWorkingSet()). The 2nd arg
 *      to the listener is the added Document.
 *    - workingSetRemove -- When a Document is removed from the working set (see getWorkingSet()). The
 *      2nd arg to the listener is the removed Document.
 *
 * These are jQuery events, so to listen for them you do something like this:
 *    $(DocumentManager).on("eventname", handler);
