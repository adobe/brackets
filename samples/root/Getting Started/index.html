        <h1>GETTING STARTED WITH BRACKETS</h1>
        <h2>This is your guide!</h2>
        
        <!--
            MADE WITH <3 AND JAVASCRIPT
        -->
        
        <p>
            Welcome to an early preview of Brackets, a new open-source editor for the next generation of
            the web. We’re big fans of standards and want to build better tooling for JavaScript, HTML and CSS 
            and related open web technologies. This is our humble beginning.
        </p>
        
        <!--
            WHAT IS BRACKETS?
        -->
        <p>
            <em>Brackets is a different type of editor.</em>
            One notable difference is that this editor is written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
            This means that most of you using Brackets have the skills necessary to modify and extend the editor.
            In fact, we use Brackets every day to build Brackets. It also has some unique features like Quick Edit,
            Live Preview and others that you may not find in other editors.
            To learn more about how to use those features, read on.
        </p>
        
        
        <h2>We're trying out a few new things</h2>
        
        <!--
            THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT
        -->
        <h3>Quick Edit for CSS and JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
            No more switching between documents and losing your context. When editing HTML, use the
            <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + E</kbd> shortcut to open a quick inline editor that displays all the related CSS.
            Make a tweak to your CSS, hit <kbd>ESC</kbd> and you’re back to editing HTML, or just leave the
            CSS rules open and they’ll become part of your HTML editor. If you hit <kbd>ESC</kbd> outside of
            a quick inline editor, they’ll all collapse.
        </p>
        
        <samp>
            Want to see it in action? Place your cursor on the <!-- <samp> --> tag above and press
            <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + E</kbd>. You should see a CSS quick editor appear above. On the right you will see
            a list of the CSS rules that are related to this tag. Simply scroll the rules with 
            <kbd>Alt + Up/Down</kbd> to find the one you want to edit.
        </samp>
        
        <a href="screenshots/quick-edit.png">
            <img alt="A screenshot showing CSS Quick Edit" src="screenshots/quick-edit.png" />
        </a>
        
        <p>
            You can use the same shortcut for JavaScript code to view the body of a function by
            placing the cursor on the name of the function you are calling. For now inline editors cannot be
            nested, so you can only use Quick Edit while the cursor is in a "full size" editor.
        </p>
        
        <!--
            LIVE PREVIEW
        -->
        <h3>Preview CSS changes live in the browser</h3>
        <p>
            You know that "save/reload dance" we've been doing for years? The one where you make changes in
            your editor, hit save, switch to the browser and then refresh to finally see the result?
            With Brackets, you don't have to do that dance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Brackets will open a <em>live connection</em> to your local browser and push CSS updates as you
            type! You might already be doing something like this today with browser-based tools, but with Brackets
            there is no need to copy and paste the final CSS back into the editor. Your code runs in the
            browser, but lives in your editor!
        </p>
        
        <h3>Live Highlight HTML elements and CSS rules</h3>
        <p>
            Brackets makes it easy to see how your changes in HTML and CSS will affect the page. When your cursor
            is on a CSS rule, Brackets will highlight all affected elements in the browser. Similarly, when editing
            an HTML file, Brackets will highlight the corresponding HTML elements in the browser.
        </p>
        
        <samp>
            If you have Google Chrome installed, you can try this out yourself. Click on the lightning bolt 
            icon in the top right corner of your Brackets window or hit <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + Alt + P</kbd>. When
            Live Preview is enabled on an HTML document, all linked CSS documents can be edited in real-time.
            The icon will change from gray to gold when Brackets establishes a connection to your browser.
            
            Now, place your cursor on the <!-- <img> --> tag above. Notice the blue highlight that appears
            around the image in Chrome. Next, use <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + E</kbd> to open up the defined CSS rules.
            Try changing the size of the border from 1px to 10px or change the background
            color from "dimgray" to "hotpink". If you have Brackets and your browser running side-by-side, you
            will see your changes instantly reflected in your browser. Cool, right?
        </samp>
                
        <p class="note">
            Today, Brackets only supports Live Preview for CSS. However, in the current version, changes to HTML
            and JavaScript files are automatically reloaded when you save. We are currently working on Live Preview
            support for HTML and JavaScript. Live previews are also only possible with Google Chrome, but we hope
            to bring this functionality to all major browsers in the future.
        </p>
                
        <h3>Quick View</h3>
        <p>
            For those of us who haven't yet memorized the color equivalents for HEX or RGB values, Brackets makes
            it quick and easy to see exactly what color is being used. In either CSS or HTML, simply hover over any
            color value or gradient and Brackets will display a preview of that color/gradient automatically. The
            same goes for images simply hover over the image link in the Brackets editor and it will display a
            thumbnail preview of that image.
        </p>
        
        <samp>
            To try out Quick View for yourself, place your cursor on the <!-- <body> --> tag at the top of this
            document and press <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + E</kbd> to open a CSS quick editor. Now simply hover over any of the
            color values within the CSS. You can also see it in action on gradients by opening a CSS quick editor
            on the HTML tag at the top of this page and hovering over any of the background image values. To test
            out the image preview, place your cursor over the screenshot image included earlier in this document.
        </samp>
