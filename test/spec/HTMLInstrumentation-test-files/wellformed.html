<h1>GETTING STARTED WITH BRACKETS</h1>
<h2>This is your guide!</h2>

<!--
    MADE WITH <3 AND JAVASCRIPT
-->

<p>
    Welcome to an early preview of Brackets, a new open-source editor for the next generation of
    the web. Weâ€™re big fans of standards and want to build better tooling for JavaScript, HTML and CSS 
    and related open web technologies. This is our humble beginning.

<!--
    WHAT IS BRACKETS?
-->
<p>
    <em>You are looking at an early build of Brackets.</em>
    In many ways, Brackets is a different type of editor. One notable difference is that this editor
    is written in JavaScript. So while Brackets might not be ready for your day-to-day use quite yet,
    we are using it every day to build Brackets.
