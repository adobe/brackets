| :warning: On September 1, 2021, Adobe will end support for Brackets. If you would like to continue using, maintaining, and improving Brackets, you may fork the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/adobe/brackets). Through Adobe’s partnership with Microsoft, we encourage users to migrate to [Visual Studio Code](https://aka.ms/brackets-to-vscode), Microsoft’s free code editor built on open source.

Welcome to Brackets! [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adobe/brackets.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adobe/brackets)
-------------------

Brackets is a modern open-source code editor for HTML, CSS
and JavaScript that's *built* in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

What makes Brackets different from other web code editors?

* **Tools shouldn't get in your way.** Instead of cluttering up your coding
environment with lots of panels and icons, the Quick Edit UI in Brackets puts 
context-specific code and tools inline.
* **Brackets is in sync with your browser.** With Live Preview, Brackets
works directly with your browser to push code edits instantly. It also jumps
back and forth between your real source code and the browser view.
* **Do it yourself.** Because Brackets is open-source which is built on HTML, CSS
and JavaScript, you are welcomed to [build](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) the best code editor for the web.

Brackets have completed first version, but we are not stopping there. We come up with many feature ideas on our
[trello board](http://bit.ly/BracketsTrelloBoard) that we are eager to add. We are planning to build  other innovative web development workflows into Brackets. 
Therefore, you are endorsed to take Brackets out for a spin and let us know how we can make it your favorite editor. 

You can see 
[screenshots of Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Brackets-Screenshots)
on the wiki, [intro videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/CodeBrackets) on YouTube, and news on the [Brackets blog](http://blog.brackets.io/).

How to install and run Brackets
-------------------------------
#### Download

To install the latest stable version on Mac, Windows and Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) can be [found here](http://brackets.io/).

#### Usage

Brackets automatically opens a folder containing simple "Getting Started" content.
You are able to choose a different folder to edit using *File > Open Folder*.

Brackets is self-explanatory, but the information on how
to use its unique features, like Quick Edit and Live Preview, please read
[How to Use Brackets](http://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Use-Brackets). 
See the [release notes](http://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Release-Notes)
for a list of new features and known issues in each build.

In addition to the core features built into Brackets, there is a large and growing
community of developers building extensions that add all sorts of useful functionality.
See the [Brackets Extension Registry](https://registry.brackets.io/)
for a list of available extensions. For installation instructions,
see the [extensions wiki page](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Brackets-Extensions).

Helping Brackets
----------------

#### I found a bug!

If you find a repeatable bug, and [troubleshooting](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Troubleshooting) 
tips do not help, then be sure to [search existing issues](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/issues) first.
Include steps to consistently reproduce the problem, actual vs. expected results, screenshots, your Oerating System and
Brackets version number. Disable all extensions to verify the issue is a core Brackets bug.
[Read more guidelines for filing good bugs.](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Report-an-Issue)


#### I have a new suggestion, but don't know how to program!

For feature requests please first check our [Trello board](http://bit.ly/BracketsBacklog) to
see if it is already there; you can upvote it if so. If not, feel free to file it as an issue as above; we'll
move it to the feature backlog for you.


#### I want to help with the code!

Awesome! _There are lots of ways you can help._ First read 
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), 
then learn how to [pull the repo and hack on Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Hack-on-Brackets).

The text editor inside Brackets is based on 
[CodeMirror](http://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror)&mdash;thanks to Marijn for
taking our pull requests, implementing feature requests and fixing bugs! See 
[Notes on CodeMirror](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Notes-on-CodeMirror)
for info on how we're using CodeMirror.

Although Brackets is built in HTML/CSS/JS, it currently runs as a desktop 
application in a thin native shell, so that it accesses your local files.
(If you just try to open the index.html file in a browser, it w will not work.)
The native shell for Brackets lives in a separate repo, 
[adobe/brackets-shell](https://github.com/adobe/brackets-shell/).


I want to keep track of how Brackets is doing!
----------------------------------------------

Not sure you needed the exclamation point there, but we like your enthusiasm.
